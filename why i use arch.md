# why i use arch

the ideas come from [Why don't you use Arch Linux? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_IPA7mFKc) make by [rwxrob](rwxrob.md) 

i think simple and just one is package manager `pacman`, `AUR` -> `yay`

normally i just use `yay` for installation any things, search package, the easy way to install package without other package manager like `flatpak`, the one from ubuntu `snap`, `ppa`, `dnf copr`

okay let's ask myself [why linux have many package manager](why%20linux%20have%20many%20package%20manager.md)

but wait what is [AUR](AUR.md)?
