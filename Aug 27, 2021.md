Today is special to me,

My YouTube channel has a guy watching my video screencast about I build my blog

He offered to give me money

This is the first time somebody has ever offered to pay me to program something.

I replied to him, what can I do for you? What error you get, and I help him just like other friends.

What do you do these days?

I have a goal is to work 14 hours a day about 100 hours week that hurts :D, this can make me burnout but yeah I never try to work hard is it,
I want to try to work hard and smart that is my focus point, maybe it's not happening in 2 or 3 days/weeks/months maybe I take me several months I guess

But yeah these things I want to try

Working 14 hours a day? Where do my ideas come from?

I watched [Jordan B. Peterson](Jordan%20B.%20Peterson.md) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UhdQud45p4):D
