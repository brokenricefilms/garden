# why i don't use titlefile name with unique ID

i ask myself question why [zettelkasten note-taking method](zettelkasten%20note-taking%20method.md) use unique title. For example {{yyyy-mm-dd title?}}. I thought maybe title maybe will conflict but why   title be conflict and me will be okay what that?

Like people name [Thuan Pham (thuanowa)](Thuan%20Pham%20(thuanowa).md) is me and [Thuan Pham (CTO of Uber)](Thuan%20Pham%20(CTO%20of%20Uber).md) is different people with same name "Thuan Pham" but i have "Thuan Pham {note}" and it will never conflict i get the ideas from wikipedia, and i don't see the use case for use unique ID title.

Maybe will have benefit from the date create note from unique ID but i don't care about the date, in daily note i think view crate the link or software already record the date.
