- I finding some good manga to read
- Think will go through all company in hcm
- Or remote, i not sure my english for communicate is okay for work with other guys
- So i think apply for top company rank in hcm, and go interview
- I have some ideas to go somewhere, travel or live alone with no money, nothings i can live with?
- See some people in internet "go to the wild"
- See a random nerd, sit all day in front of computer, can go to the wild
- No social skill at less can talk, can write, can think
- What the jobs fit to me, so when programming i can sit all day not eating
- I don't know more than one job can fit to me
- So right now stay healthy and focus what i can to do in my faking life
