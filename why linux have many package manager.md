# why linux have many package manager

take look at [The Biggest Failure Of Linux Is Package Management - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLGdoL7xa3o)  same what my [why i use arch](why%20i%20use%20arch.md) reason the [AUR](AUR.md)

yep [AUR](AUR.md) not prefect, some package broken, but still the best of i think maybe can compare with [DNF](DNF.md)
