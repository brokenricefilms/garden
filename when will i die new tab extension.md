how to save data? 

-> [Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookies](Local%20Storage,%20Session%20Storage%20and%20Cookies.md) recently [ông dev](ông%20dev.md) have video talk about that, i think will using local storage for now because in this version i don't have server for doing anything, or maybe in the future i think can easily change to cookies cuz my extension kinda simple
