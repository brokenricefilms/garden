# The problem with active recall and spaced repetition

- yep, i try some active recall and spaced repetition before, i remember in high school i used flashcards for first thing in English, biology and some class takes me the good score to remember some stuff, you know most of the things in math in the high school i trust thing ⇾ yep i have a framework when i remember this frame and some related stuff i will become good at math basically like this. I'm using the Anki app to try to remember the formula but it seen like not work for me because i lazy to repeat and repeat something fucking boring with me, yep.
- basically, this is not bad but not good to try to better learn something, when you study in 8h but your brain you're technical, not good so 8h study → something like 2h (better thinking get a better result).
- so what, you know learning like a skill to work with this, not like something the 10 m on YouTube will help you to 0 → 100% yep, it will be a long time to get better learning, and basically, it's thinking your thinking must be training, and you have to research different things you fit with this, that the way i think.
