# what about zettelkasten + mind map?

- i think [peter draw have the good mind map](peter%20draw%20have%20the%20good%20mind%20map.md) among of shit mind map out there, it have connection, focus to the goal, but i think this like brainstorming stuff, messy
- i really want to do what [Justin Sung](Justin%20Sung.md) say about the mind map, it clean, simple visualization for me, i want make the mind map + zettelkasten work together
